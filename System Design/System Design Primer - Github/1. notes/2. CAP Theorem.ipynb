    "        - Obviously, a call will only go to one person. Consequently, this means that any note will only appear in 1 notebook, either yours, or your wife's!\n",

    "        - If someone doesn't report to work for a span of time, before taking new calls, they will update their notebook with the missing entries.\n",
